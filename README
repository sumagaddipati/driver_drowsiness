# Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect signs of drowsiness in drivers. It can be used to alert drivers when they show signs of fatigue, promoting safety on the road.

## Features
- Detects the driver's face using a webcam or video input.
- Analyzes eye movement to determine if the driver is drowsy.
- Provides real-time feedback and visual alerts if drowsiness is detected.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow (if using deep learning models)
- dlib (for face and facial landmark detection)
- Other dependencies (list any specific libraries you used)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib tensorflow numpy

**How It Works**
The driver_drowsiness.py script performs the following steps:

Face Detection: It uses OpenCV or dlib to detect the face of the driver in real-time.

Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR): The script calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) from facial landmarks to detect whether the driverâ€™s eyes are closed for too long, indicating drowsiness.

Alert System: If the EAR falls below a certain threshold, it triggers an alert (visual or sound).
